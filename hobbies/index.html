	My name is Callie Stanfield, and I spend my spare time coaching softball, going camping with my family, and riding bicycles. A commonality among my hobbies are that I enjoy spending time with my family, sports, and time outdoors also.

  		<summary>Hobby Number Two</summary>
  		<p> A second hobby I enjoy is camping with my husband and daughter. She enjoys walking on the trails as we push her in the wagon. One of our favorite campgrounds is in Florida right across the road from the beach. I am going to include a park map for the campground, and a picture of the beach there also. </p>
