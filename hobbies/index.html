  		<summary>Hobby Two</summary>
  		<p> A second hobby I enjoy is camping with my husband and daughter. She enjoys walking on the trails as we push her in the wagon. One of our favorite campgrounds is in Florida right across the road from the beach. I am going to include a park map for the campground, and a picture of the beach there also. </p>
